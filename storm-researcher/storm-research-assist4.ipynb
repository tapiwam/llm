It uses YAML files to configure the application's services and performs the creation and start-up process of all the containers with a single command. The docker-compose CLI utility allows users to run commands on multiple containers at once; for example, building images, scaling containers, running containers that were stopped, and more. Commands related to image manipulation, or user-interactive options, are not relevant in Docker Compose because they address one container. The docker-compose.yml file is used to define an application's services and includes various configuration options. For example, the build option defines configuration options such as the Dockerfile path, the command option allows one to override default Docker commands, and more. The first public beta version of Docker Compose (version 0.0.1) was released on December 21, 2013. The first production-ready version (1.0) was made available on October 16, 2014.\\nDocker Swarm provides native clustering functionality for Docker containers, which turns a group of Docker engines into a single virtual Docker engine. In Docker 1.12 and higher, Swarm mode is integrated with Docker Engine. The docker swarm CLI utility allows users to run Swarm containers, create discovery tokens, list nodes in the cluster, and more. The docker node CLI utility allows users to run various commands to manage nodes in a swarm, for example, listing the nodes in a swarm, updating nodes, and removing nodes from the swarm. Docker manages swarms using the Raft consensus algorithm. According to Raft, for an update to be performed, the majority of Swarm nodes need to agree on the update.\\nDocker Volume facilitates the independent persistence of data, allowing data to remain even after the container is deleted or re-created.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nDocker Inc. was founded by Kamel Founadi, Solomon Hykes, and Sebastien Pahl during the Y Combinator Summer 2010 startup incubator group and launched in 2011. The startup was also one of the 12 startups in Founder's Den first cohort. Hykes started the Docker project in France as an internal project within dotCloud, a platform-as-a-service company.\\nDocker debuted to the public in Santa Clara at PyCon in 2013. It was released as open-source in March 2013. At the time, it used LXC as its default execution environment. One year later, with the release of version 0.9, Docker replaced LXC with its own component, libcontainer, which was written in the Go programming language.\\nIn 2017, Docker created the Moby project for open research and development.\\n\\n\\n=== Adoption ===\\nSeptember 19, 2013: Red Hat and Docker announced a collaboration around Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and OpenShift.\\nOctober 15, 2014: Microsoft announced the integration of the Docker engine into Windows Server, as well as native support for the Docker client role in Windows.\\nNovember 2014: Docker container services were announced for the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).\\nNovember 10, 2014: Docker announced a partnership with Stratoscale.\\nDecember 4, 2014: IBM announced a strategic partnership with Docker that enables Docker to integrate more closely with the IBM Cloud.\\nJune 22, 2015: Docker and several other companies announced that they were working on a new vendor and operating-system-independent standard for software containers.\\nDecember 2015: Oracle Cloud added Docker container support after acquiring StackEngine, a Docker container startup.\\nApril 2016: Windocks, an independent software vendor released a port of Docker's\", 'Docker (software)\\n\\nDocker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. \\nThe service has both free and premium tiers.

It was first released in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.\\nDocker is a tool that is used to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight containers so that applications can work efficiently in different environments in isolation.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nContainers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.\\n\\n\\n=== Operation ===\\n\\nDocker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux, Windows, or macOS computer. This enables the application to run in a variety of locations, such as on-premises, in public (see decentralized computing, distributed computing, and cloud computing) or private cloud. When running on Linux, Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel (such as cgroups and kernel namespaces) and a union-capable file system (such as OverlayFS) to allow containers to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines. Docker on macOS uses a Linux virtual machine to run the containers.\\nBecause Docker containers are lightweight, a single server or virtual machine can run several containers simultaneously. A 2018 analysis found that a typical Docker use case involves running eight containers per host, and that a quarter of analyzed organizations run 18 or more per host. It can also be installed on a single board computer like the Raspberry Pi.\\nThe Linux kernel\\'s support for namespaces mostly isolates an application\\'s view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user IDs and mounted file systems, while the kernel\\'s cgroups provide resource limiting for memory and CPU. Since version 0.9, Docker includes its own component (called libcontainer) to use virtualization facilities provided directly by the Linux kernel, in addition to using abstracted virtualization interfaces via libvirt, LXC and systemd-nspawn.\\nDocker implements a high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation.\\n\\n\\n== Licensing model ==\\nThe Docker Engine is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Docker Desktop distributes some components that are licensed under the GNU General Public License.\\nThe Dockerfile files can be licensed under an open-source license themselves. The scope of such a license statement is only the Dockerfile and not the container image.\\n\\n\\n== Components ==\\nThe Docker software as a service offering consists of three components:\\n\\nSoftware: The Docker daemon, called dockerd, is a persistent process that manages Docker containers and handles container objects. The daemon listens for requests sent via the Docker Engine API. The Docker client program, called docker, provides a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with Docker daemons.\\nObjects: Docker objects are various entities used to assemble an application in Docker. The main classes of Docker objects are images, containers, and services.\\nA Docker container is a standardized, encapsulated environment that runs applications. A container is managed using the Docker API or CLI. It is a process created from an image.\\nA Docker image is a read-only template used to build containers. Images are used to store and ship applications. It is a process image.\\nA Docker service allows containers to be scaled across multiple Docker daemons. The result is known as a swarm, a set of cooperating daemons that communicate through the Docker API.\\nRegistries: A Docker registry is a repository for Docker images. Docker clients connect to registries to download (\"pull\") images for use or upload (\"push\") images that they have built. Registries can be public or private. The main public registry is Docker Hub. Docker Hub is the default registry where Docker looks for images. Docker registries also allow the creation of notifications based on events.\\nAn illustrative example of a Dockerfile:'], 'uris': None, 'data': None}\n",

It uses YAML files to configure the application's services and performs the creation and start-up process of all the containers with a single command. The docker-compose CLI utility allows users to run commands on multiple containers at once; for example, building images, scaling containers, running containers that were stopped, and more. Commands related to image manipulation, or user-interactive options, are not relevant in Docker Compose because they address one container. The docker-compose.yml file is used to define an application's services and includes various configuration options. For example, the build option defines configuration options such as the Dockerfile path, the command option allows one to override default Docker commands, and more. The first public beta version of Docker Compose (version 0.0.1) was released on December 21, 2013. The first production-ready version (1.0) was made available on October 16, 2014.\\nDocker Swarm provides native clustering functionality for Docker containers, which turns a group of Docker engines into a single virtual Docker engine. In Docker 1.12 and higher, Swarm mode is integrated with Docker Engine. The docker swarm CLI utility allows users to run Swarm containers, create discovery tokens, list nodes in the cluster, and more. The docker node CLI utility allows users to run various commands to manage nodes in a swarm, for example, listing the nodes in a swarm, updating nodes, and removing nodes from the swarm. Docker manages swarms using the Raft consensus algorithm. According to Raft, for an update to be performed, the majority of Swarm nodes need to agree on the update.\\nDocker Volume facilitates the independent persistence of data, allowing data to remain even after the container is deleted or re-created.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nDocker Inc. was founded by Kamel Founadi, Solomon Hykes, and Sebastien Pahl during the Y Combinator Summer 2010 startup incubator group and launched in 2011. The startup was also one of the 12 startups in Founder's Den first cohort. Hykes started the Docker project in France as an internal project within dotCloud, a platform-as-a-service company.\\nDocker debuted to the public in Santa Clara at PyCon in 2013. It was released as open-source in March 2013. At the time, it used LXC as its default execution environment. One year later, with the release of version 0.9, Docker replaced LXC with its own component, libcontainer, which was written in the Go programming language.\\nIn 2017, Docker created the Moby project for open research and development.\\n\\n\\n=== Adoption ===\\nSeptember 19, 2013: Red Hat and Docker announced a collaboration around Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and OpenShift.\\nOctober 15, 2014: Microsoft announced the integration of the Docker engine into Windows Server, as well as native support for the Docker client role in Windows.\\nNovember 2014: Docker container services were announced for the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).\\nNovember 10, 2014: Docker announced a partnership with Stratoscale.\\nDecember 4, 2014: IBM announced a strategic partnership with Docker that enables Docker to integrate more closely with the IBM Cloud.\\nJune 22, 2015: Docker and several other companies announced that they were working on a new vendor and operating-system-independent standard for software containers.\\nDecember 2015: Oracle Cloud added Docker container support after acquiring StackEngine, a Docker container startup.\\nApril 2016: Windocks, an independent software vendor released a port of Docker's\", 'Docker (software)\\n\\nDocker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. \\nThe service has both free and premium tiers.

The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine. It was first released in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.\\nDocker is a tool that is used to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight containers so that applications can work efficiently in different environments in isolation.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\nContainers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.\\n\\n\\n=== Operation ===\\n\\nDocker can package an application and its dependencies in a virtual container that can run on any Linux, Windows, or macOS computer. This enables the application to run in a variety of locations, such as on-premises, in public (see decentralized computing, distributed computing, and cloud computing) or private cloud. When running on Linux, Docker uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel (such as cgroups and kernel namespaces) and a union-capable file system (such as OverlayFS) to allow containers to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines. Docker on macOS uses a Linux virtual machine to run the containers.\\nBecause Docker containers are lightweight, a single server or virtual machine can run several containers simultaneously. A 2018 analysis found that a typical Docker use case involves running eight containers per host, and that a quarter of analyzed organizations run 18 or more per host. It can also be installed on a single board computer like the Raspberry Pi.\\nThe Linux kernel\\'s support for namespaces mostly isolates an application\\'s view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user IDs and mounted file systems, while the kernel\\'s cgroups provide resource limiting for memory and CPU. Since version 0.9, Docker includes its own component (called libcontainer) to use virtualization facilities provided directly by the Linux kernel, in addition to using abstracted virtualization interfaces via libvirt, LXC and systemd-nspawn.\\nDocker implements a high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation.\\n\\n\\n== Licensing model ==\\nThe Docker Engine is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Docker Desktop distributes some components that are licensed under the GNU General Public License.\\nThe Dockerfile files can be licensed under an open-source license themselves. The scope of such a license statement is only the Dockerfile and not the container image.\\n\\n\\n== Components ==\\nThe Docker software as a service offering consists of three components:\\n\\nSoftware: The Docker daemon, called dockerd, is a persistent process that manages Docker containers and handles container objects. The daemon listens for requests sent via the Docker Engine API. The Docker client program, called docker, provides a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with Docker daemons.\\nObjects: Docker objects are various entities used to assemble an application in Docker. The main classes of Docker objects are images, containers, and services.\\nA Docker container is a standardized, encapsulated environment that runs applications. A container is managed using the Docker API or CLI. It is a process created from an image.\\nA Docker image is a read-only template used to build containers. Images are used to store and ship applications. It is a process image.\\nA Docker service allows containers to be scaled across multiple Docker daemons. The result is known as a swarm, a set of cooperating daemons that communicate through the Docker API.\\nRegistries: A Docker registry is a repository for Docker images. Docker clients connect to registries to download (\"pull\") images for use or upload (\"push\") images that they have built. Registries can be public or private. The main public registry is Docker Hub. Docker Hub is the default registry where Docker looks for images. Docker registries also allow the creation of notifications based on events.\\nAn illustrative example of a Dockerfile:'], 'uris': None, 'data': None}\n",

Containerization, also referred as container stuffing or container loading, is the process of unitization of cargoes in exports. Containerization is the predominant form of unitization of export cargoes, as opposed to other systems such as the barge system or palletization. The containers have standardized dimensions. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—container ships, rail transport flatcars, and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The handling system is mechanized so that all handling is done with cranes and special forklift trucks. All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems.\\nContainerization originated several centuries ago but was not well developed or widely applied until after World War II, when it dramatically reduced the costs of transport, supported the post-war boom in international trade, and was a major element in globalization. Containerization eliminated manual sorting of most shipments and the need for dock front warehouses, while displacing many thousands of dock workers who formerly simply handled break bulk cargo. Containerization reduced congestion in ports, significantly shortened shipping time, and reduced losses from damage and theft.\\nContainers can be made from a wide range of materials such as steel, fibre-reinforced polymer, aluminum or a combination. Containers made from weathering steel are used to minimize maintenance needs.', 'title': 'Containerization'}, {'categories': \"['All Wikipedia articles written in American English', 'All articles

Containerization, also referred as container stuffing or container loading, is the process of unitization of cargoes in exports. Containerization is the predominant form of unitization of export cargoes, as opposed to other systems such as the barge system or palletization. The containers have standardized dimensions. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—container ships, rail transport flatcars, and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The handling system is mechanized so that all handling is done with cranes and special forklift trucks. All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems.\\nContainerization originated several centuries ago but was not well developed or widely applied until after World War II, when it dramatically reduced the costs of transport, supported the post-war boom in international trade, and was a major element in globalization. Containerization eliminated manual sorting of most shipments and the need for dock front warehouses, while displacing many thousands of dock workers who formerly simply handled break bulk cargo. Containerization reduced congestion in ports, significantly shortened shipping time, and reduced losses from damage and theft.\\nContainers can be made from a wide range of materials such as steel, fibre-reinforced polymer, aluminum or a combination. Containers made from weathering steel are used to minimize maintenance needs.', 'title': 'Containerization'}, {'categories': \"['All Wikipedia articles written in American English', 'All articles

Containerization reduced congestion in ports, significantly shortened shipping time, and reduced losses from damage and theft.\\nContainers can be made from a wide range of materials such as steel, fibre-reinforced polymer, aluminum or a combination. Containers made from weathering steel are used to minimize maintenance needs.', 'title': 'Containerization'}], 'documents': ['Before containerization, goods were usually handled manually as break bulk cargo. Typically, goods would be loaded onto a vehicle from the factory and taken to a port warehouse where they would be offloaded and stored awaiting the next vessel. When the vessel arrived, they would be moved to the side of the ship along with other cargo to be lowered or carried into the hold and packed by dock workers. The ship might call at several other ports before off-loading a given consignment of cargo. Each port visit would delay the delivery of other cargo. Delivered cargo might then have been offloaded into another warehouse before being picked up and delivered to its destination. Multiple handling and delays made transport costly, time-consuming and unreliable.\\nContainerization has its origins in early coal mining regions in England beginning in the late 18th century. In 1766 James Brindley designed the box boat \\'Starvationer\\' with ten wooden containers, to transport coal from Worsley Delph (quarry) to Manchester by Bridgewater Canal. In 1795, Benjamin Outram opened the Little Eaton Gangway, upon which coal was carried in wagons built at his Butterley Ironwork. The horse-drawn wheeled wagons on the gangway took the form of containers, which, loaded with coal, could be transshipped from canal barges on the Derby Canal, which Outram had also promoted.\\nBy the 1830s, railroads were carrying containers that could be transferred to other modes of transport. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway in the UK was one of these, making use of \"simple rectangular timber boxes\" to convey coal from Lancashire collieries to Liverpool, where a crane transferred them to horse-drawn carriages. Originally used for moving coal on and off barges, \"loose boxes\" were used to containerize coal from the late 1780s, at places like the Bridgewater Canal. By the 1840s, iron boxes were in use as well as wooden ones. The early 1900s saw the adoption of closed container boxes designed for movement between road and rail.', '=== Twentieth century ===\\nOn 17 May 1917, Louisville, Kentucky native Benjamin Franklin \"B. F.\" Fitch (1877–1956) launched commercial use of \"demountable bodies\" in Cincinnati, Ohio, which he had designed as transferable containers. In 1919, his system was extended to over 200 containers serving 21 railway stations with 14 freight trucks.\\nIn 1919, Stanisław Rodowicz, an engineer, developed the first draft of the container system in Poland. In 1920, he built a prototype of the biaxial wagon. The Polish-Bolshevik War stopped development of the container system in Poland.\\nThe U.S. Post Office contracted with the New York Central Railroad to move mail via containers in May 1921. In 1930, the Chicago & Northwestern Railroad began shipping containers between Chicago and Milwaukee. Their efforts ended in the spring of 1931 when the Interstate Commerce Commission disallowed the use of a flat rate for the containers.\\nIn 1926, a regular connection of the luxury passenger train from London to Paris, Golden Arrow/Fleche d\\'Or, by Southern Railway and French Northern Railway, began. For transport of passengers\\' baggage four containers were used. These containers were loaded in London or Paris and carried to ports, Dover or Calais, on flat cars in the UK and \"CIWL Pullman Golden Arrow Fourgon of CIWL\" in France. At the Second World Motor Transport Congress in Rome, September 1928, Italian senator Silvio Crespi proposed the use of containers for road and railway transport systems, using collaboration rather than competition. This would be done under the auspices of an international organ similar to the Sleeping Car Company, which provided international carriage of passengers in sleeping wagons. In 1928 Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) started regular container service in the northeast U.S. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929 in New York and the subsequent Great Depression, many countries were without any means to transport cargo. The railroads were sought as a possibility to transport cargo, and there was an opportunity to bring containers into broader use. In February 1931 the first container ship was launched. It was called the Autocarrier, owned by Southern Railway UK. It had 21 slots for containers of Southern Railway. Under auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris in Venice on September 30, 1931, on one of the platforms of the Maritime Station (Mole di Ponente), practical tests assessed the best construction for European containers as part of an international competition.\\nIn 1931, in the U.S., B. F. Fitch designed the two largest and heaviest containers in existence. One measured 17 ft 6 in (5.33 m) by 8 ft 0 in (2.44 m) by 8 ft 0 in (2.44 m) with a capacity of 30,000 pounds (14,000 kg) in 890 cubic feet (25 m3), and a second measured 20 ft 0 in (6.10 m) by 8 ft 0 in (2.44 m) by 8 ft 0 in (2.44 m), with a capacity of 50,000 pounds (23,000 kg) in 1,000 cubic feet (28 m3).\\nIn November 1932, in Enola, PA, the first container terminal in the world was opened by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Fitch hooking system was used for reloading of the containers.\\nThe development of containerization was created in Europe and the U.S. as a way to revitalize rail companies after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, which had caused economic collapse and reduction in use of all modes of transport.\\nIn 1933 in Europe, under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce, the International Container Bureau (French: Bureau International des Conteneurs, B.I.C.) was established. In June 1933, the B.I.C. decided on obligatory parameters for containers used in international traffic. Containers handled by means of lifting gear, such as cranes, overhead conveyors, etc. for traveling elevators (group I containers), constructed after July 1, 1933. Obligatory Regulations:\\n\\nClause 1. Containers are, as regards form, either of the closed or the open type, and, as regards capacity, either of the heavy or the light type.\\nClause 2. The loading capacity of containers must be such that their total weight (load, plus tare) is: 5 tonnes (4.92 long tons; 5.51 short tons) for containers of the heavy type; 2.5 tonnes (2.46 long tons; 2.76 short tons) for containers of the light type; a tolerance of 5 percent excess on the total weight is allowable under the same conditions as', 'Containerization\\n\\nContainerization is a system of intermodal freight transport using intermodal containers (also called shipping containers, or ISO containers).

Containers made from weathering steel are used to minimize maintenance needs.\\n\\nContainerization is a system of intermodal freight transport using intermodal containers (also called shipping containers, or ISO containers). Containerization, also referred as container stuffing or container loading, is the process of unitization of cargoes in exports. Containerization is the predominant form of unitization of export cargoes, as opposed to other systems such as the barge system or palletization. The containers have standardized dimensions. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—container ships, rail transport flatcars, and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The handling system is mechanized so that all handling is done with cranes and special forklift trucks. All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems.\\nContainerization originated several centuries ago but was not well developed or widely applied until after World War II, when it dramatically reduced the costs of transport, supported the post-war boom in international trade, and was a major element in globalization. Containerization eliminated manual sorting of most shipments and the need for dock front warehouses, while displacing many thousands of dock workers who formerly simply handled break bulk cargo. Containerization reduced congestion in ports, significantly shortened shipping time, and reduced losses from damage and theft.\\nContainers can be made from a wide range of materials such as steel, fibre-reinforced polymer, aluminum or a combination.

Individually, each container simulates a different software application and runs isolated processes by bundling related configuration files, libraries and dependencies. But, collectively, multiple containers share a common operating system kernel (OS).In recent times, the containerization technology has been widely adopted by cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure,  Google Cloud Platform, and IBM Cloud. Containerization has also been pursued by the U.S. Department of Defense as a way of more rapidly developing and fielding software updates, with first application in its F-22 air superiority fighter.\\n\\n\\n== Types of containers ==\\nOS containers\\nApplication containers\\n\\n\\n=== Security issues ===\\nBecause of the shared OS, security threats can affect the whole containerized system.\\nIn containerized environments, security scanners generally protect the OS, but not the application containers, which adds unwanted vulnerability.\\n\\n\\n== Container management, orchestration, clustering ==\\nContainer orchestration or container management is mostly used in the context of application containers. Implementations providing such orchestration include Kubernetes and Docker swarm.\\n\\n\\n== Container cluster management ==\\nContainer clusters need to be managed. This includes functionality to create a cluster, to upgrade the software or repair it, balance the load between existing instances, scale by starting or stopping instances to adapt to the number of users, to log activities and monitor produced logs or the application itself by querying sensors. Open-source implementations of such software include OKD and Rancher. Quite a number of companies provide container cluster management as a managed service, like Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Microsoft.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nDocker (software)\\nKubernetes\\nOpen Container Initiative\\nVirtual machines'], 'uris': None, 'data': None}\n",

DevOps is complementary to agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the agile way of working.\\n\\n', 'title': 'DevOps'}], 'documents': ['=== ArchOps ===\\nArchOps presents an extension for DevOps practice, starting from software architecture artifacts, instead of source code, for operation deployment. ArchOps states that architectural models are first-class entities in software development, deployment, and operations.\\n\\n\\n=== Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) ===\\n\\nAutomation is a core principle for achieving DevOps success and CI/CD is a critical component. Plus, improved collaboration and communication between and within teams helps achieve faster time to market, with reduced risks.\\n\\n\\n=== Mobile DevOps ===\\n\\nMobile DevOps is a set of practices that applies the principles of DevOps specifically to the development of mobile applications. Traditional DevOps focuses on streamlining the software development process in general, but mobile development has its own unique challenges that require a tailored approach. Mobile DevOps is not simply as a branch of DevOps specific to mobile app development, instead an extension and reinterpretation of the DevOps philosophy due to very specific requirements of the mobile world.\\n\\n\\n=== Site-reliability engineering ===\\n\\nIn 2003, Google developed site reliability engineering (SRE), an approach for releasing new features continuously into large-scale high-availability systems while maintaining high-quality end-user experience. While SRE predates the development of DevOps, they are generally viewed as being related to each other.\\n\\n\\n=== Toyota production system, lean thinking, kaizen ===\\n\\nToyota production system, also known under the acronym TPS, was the inspiration for lean thinking with its focus on continuous improvement, kaizen, flow and small batches. The andon cord principle to create fast feedback, swarm and solve problems stems from TPS.\\n\\n\\n=== DevSecOps, shifting security left ===\\nDevSecOps is an augmentation of DevOps to allow for security practices to be integrated into the DevOps approach. Contrary to a traditional centralized security team model, each delivery team is empowered to factor in the correct security controls into their software delivery. Security practices and testing are performed earlier in the development lifecycle, hence the term \"shift left\". Security is tested in three main areas: static, software composition, and dynamic.\\nChecking software statically via static application security testing (SAST) is white-box testing with special focus on security. Depending on the programming language, different tools are needed to do such static code analysis. The software composition is analyzed, especially libraries, and the version of each component is checked against vulnerability lists published by CERT and other expert groups. When giving software to clients, library licenses and their match to the license of the software distributed are in focus, especially copyleft licenses.\\nIn dynamic testing, also called black-box testing, software is tested without knowing its inner functions. In DevSecOps this practice may be referred to as dynamic application security testing (DAST) or penetration testing. The goal is early detection of defects including cross-site scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities. Threat types are published by the open web application security project, e.g. its TOP10, and by other bodies. \\nDevSecOps has also been described as a cultural shift involving a holistic approach to producing secure software by integrating security education, security by design, and security automation.\\n\\n\\n== Cultural change ==\\nDevOps initiatives can create cultural changes in companies by transforming the way operations, developers, and testers collaborate during the development and delivery proc', 'DevOps\\n\\nDevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle. DevOps is complementary to agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the agile way of working.\\n\\n\\n\\nDevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle. DevOps is complementary to agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the agile way of working.\\n\\n\\n== Definition ==\\nOther than it being a cross-functional combination (and a portmanteau) of the terms and concepts for \"development\" and \"operations\", academics and practitioners have not developed a universal definition for the term \"DevOps\". Most often, DevOps is characterized by key principles: shared ownership, workflow automation, and rapid feedback.\\nFrom an academic perspective, Len Bass, Ingo Weber, and Liming Zhu—three computer science researchers from the CSIRO and the Software Engineering Institute—suggested defining DevOps as \"a set of practices intended to reduce the time between committing a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality\".\\nHowever, the term is used in multiple contexts. At its most successful, DevOps is a combination of specific practices, culture change, and tools.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nProposals to combine software development methodologies with deployment and operations concepts began to appear in the late 80s and early 90s.\\nAround 2007 and 2008, concerns were raised by those within the software development and IT communities that the separation between the two industries, where one wrote and created software entirely separate from those that deploy and support the software was creating a fatal level of dysfunction within the industry.\\nIn 2009, the first conference named DevOps Days was held in Ghent, Belgium. The conference was founded by Belgian consultant, project manager and agile practitioner Patrick Debois. The conference has now spread to other countries.\\nIn 2012, a report called \"State of DevOps\" was first published by Alanna Brown at Puppet Labs.\\nAs of 2014, the annual State of DevOps report was published by Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, Jez Humble and others. They stated that the adoption of DevOps was accelerating. Also in 2014, Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory wrote the book More Agile Testing, containing a chapter on testing and DevOps.\\nIn 2016, the DORA metrics for throughput (deployment frequency, lead time for changes), and stability (mean time to recover, change failure rate) were published in the State of DevOps report. However, the research methodology and metrics were criticized by experts. In response to these criticisms, the 2023 State of DevOps report  published changes that updated the stability metric \"mean time to recover\" to \"failed deployment recovery time\" acknowledging the confusion the former metric has caused.\\n\\n\\n== Relationship to other approaches ==\\nMany of the ideas fundamental to DevOps practices are inspired by, or mirror, other well known practices such as Lean and Deming\\'s Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, through to The Toyota Way and the Agile approach of breaking down components and batch sizes. Contrary to the \"top-down\" prescriptive approach and rigid framework of ITIL in the 1990s, DevOps is \"bottom-up\" and flexible, having been created by software engineers for their own needs.\\n\\n\\n=== Agile ===\\n\\nThe motivations for what has become modern DevOps and several standard DevOps practices such as automated build and test, continuous integration, and continuous delivery originated in the Agile world, which dates (informally) to the 1990s, and formally to 2001. Agile development teams using methods such as extreme programming couldn\\'t \"satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software\" unless they took responsibility for operations and infrastructure for their applications, automating much of that work. Because Scrum emerged as the dominant Agile framework in the early 2000s and it omitted the engineering practices that were part of many Agile teams, the movement to automate operations and infrastructure functions splintered from Agile and expanded into what has become modern DevOps. Today, DevOps focuses on the deployment of developed software, whether it is developed using Agile oriented methodologies or other methodologies.'], 'uris': None, 'data': None}\n",

It covers the entire application lifecycle and enables DevOps capabilities. Azure DevOps can be used as a back-end to numerous integrated development environments (IDEs) but is tailored for Microsoft Visual Studio and Eclipse on all platforms.', 'title': 'Azure DevOps Server'}], 'documents': ['=== Clients ===\\nAzure DevOps supports Visual Studio 2010 and later, Microsoft Test Manager (MTM) 2012, and 2013. Eclipse, older versions of Visual Studio, and other environments can be plugged into Azure DevOps using the Microsoft Source Code Control Integration Provider (MSSCCI Provider – pronounced “Miss-Key”). These tools provide full access to the features in Azure DevOps.\\nMicrosoft Excel and Microsoft Project are also supported to help manage work items which allows for bulk update, bulk entry and bulk export of work items. Microsoft Project can be used to schedule work when conforming to a waterfall software development methodology. Both Excel and Project support bi-directional updates of data. This allows, for example, project managers to put a schedule in Project, have that work imported into Azure DevOps where developers update the work and then the schedule can be updated without the project manager having to perform extra work.\\nWith Team Foundation Server 2012, Microsoft PowerPoint was also integrated with Azure DevOps to enable rapid storyboard development to help with the requirements management process. The integration provides extensible storyboard shapes that can be used to build any type of interface mockup that can then be animated with PowerPoint\\'s built-in functions. These storyboards can then be linked to work items.\\nIn an effort to handle the growing geographic dispersion of teams and to involve stakeholders earlier and more often in the process, Microsoft added the Feedback Client. This tool allows users to exercise an application, annotate what they are seeing with audio and video, capture screens and provide contextual feedback to the development team. This provides specific feedback on the functions of an application from a users’ perspective without requiring meetings and demonstration sessions. Azure DevOps also provides for command line tools for both Unix and Windows environments. The Power Tools for TFS include a Windows shell integration that allows users to check files in and out, add files and perform other basic tasks by right-clicking on a file or folder.\\n\\n\\n== Work items ==\\nAt the heart of Azure DevOps is the \"work item\". A work item represents a thing – it can be work that needs to be accomplished, a risk to track, a test case, a bug or virtually anything else a user can imagine. Work items are defined through the XML documents and are highly extensible. Work items are combined into a Process Template that contains these and other pieces of information to provide a development framework. Azure DevOps includes Process Templates for the Microsoft Solutions Framework for Agile, Scrum and CMMI. Teams can choose to use a built-in template or one of the many templates available for use created by third parties. Process templates can be customized using the Process Template Editor, which is part of the Power Tools.\\nWork items can be linked to each other using different relationships to create a hierarchical tree of work items or a flat relationship between work items. Work items can also be linked to external artifacts such as web pages, documents on a file share or documents stored in another repository such as SharePoint. Work items can also be linked to source code, build results, test results and specific versions of items in source control.\\nThe flexibility in the work item system allows Azure DevOps to play many roles from requirement', 'Azure DevOps Server\\n\\nAzure DevOps Server, formerly known as Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), is a Microsoft product that provides version control (either with Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) or Git), reporting, requirements management, project management (for both agile software development and waterfall teams), automated builds, testing and release management capabilities. It covers the entire application lifecycle and enables DevOps capabilities.

It covers the entire application lifecycle and enables DevOps capabilities. Azure DevOps can be used as a back-end to numerous integrated development environments (IDEs) but is tailored for Microsoft Visual Studio and Eclipse on all platforms.\\n\\n\\n== On-premises vs. online ==\\nAzure DevOps is available in two different forms: on-premises (\"Server\") and online (\"Services\").  The latter form is called Azure DevOps Services (formerly Visual Studio Online before it was renamed to Visual Studio Team Services in 2015). The cloud service is backed by the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. It uses the same code as the on-premises version of Azure DevOps, with minor modifications, and implements the most recent features. A user signs in using a Microsoft account to set up an environment, creating projects and adding team members. New features developed in short development cycles are added to the cloud version first. These features migrate to the on-premises version as updates, at approximately three-month intervals.\\n\\n\\n== Architecture ==\\n\\n\\n=== Server architecture ===\\nAzure DevOps is built on multi-tier, scalable architecture. The primary structure consists of an application tier responsible for processing logic and maintaining the web application portal (referred to as Team Web Access or TWA). Azure DevOps is built using Windows Communication Foundation web services. These may be consumed by any client, although the client object model is recommended. The data tier and application tier can exist on the same machine.\\nTo support scalability, the application tier can be load balanced and the data tier can be clustered. If using Microsoft SQL Server 2012 or later, AlwaysOn SQL Server Failover Clusters and Availability Groups are supported which allows for geographic replication of data. The primary container is the project collection. A project collection is a database that contains a group of Team Projects. The Project Collection is another scalability mechanism, in that each collection can be placed on different SQL Servers or SQL Server instances. \\'Oe\\' configuration database per Azure DevOps instance stores project collection metadata. Data from the project collection databases is aggregated into the warehouse database, which denormalizes the data in preparation for loading into an Analysis Services cube. The warehouse and the cube allow complex trend reporting and data analysis.\\nAzure DevOps can integrate with an existing SharePoint farm. SQL Server Reporting Services are supported for more advanced reporting against the data warehouse or the Analysis Services data cube. These installations can be on the same system or on different systems. Build servers, lab management servers, release management servers and proxy servers (to reduce some of the load on the application tier), test machines and load test machines can also be added to the infrastructure. To support teams requiring enterprise project scheduling, Azure DevOps also integrates with Microsoft Project Server, which allows enterprise level portfolio management, resource management and project tracking.\\n\\n\\n=== Extensibility ===\\nMicrosoft provides two standalone redistributed APIs for connecting to Azure DevOps. One is a  Java SDK, the other is a .NET Framework SDK. These APIs allow for client connectivity to Azure DevOps. Because Azure DevOps is written on a service-oriented architecture, it can communicate with virtually any tool that can call a web service. Another extensible mechanism is subscribing to system alerts: for example, alerts that a work item was changed, or a build completed. There are approximately 20 preconfigured alerts, and teams can configure as many additional alerts as needed. When used in an extensible scenario, these alerts can be sent to a web service, triggering actions to alter or update work items (such as implementing advanced business rules or generating work items programmatically based on a given scenario).\\nThe data warehouse can also be extended through the creation of custom data warehouse adapters. With the introduction of TFS 2012, custom add-ins can also be created for Team Web Access, called Web Access Extensions.'], 'uris': None, 'data': None}\n",

In general, the tools forming a toolchain are executed consecutively so the output or resulting environment state of each tool becomes the input or starting environment for the next one, but the term is also used when referring to a set of related tools that are not necessarily executed consecutively.\\nAs DevOps is a set of practices that emphasizes the collaboration and communication of both software developers and other information technology (IT) professionals, while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes, its implementation can include the definition of the series of tools used at various stages of the lifecycle; because DevOps is a cultural shift and collaboration between development and operations, there is no one product that can be considered a single DevOps tool. Instead a collection of tools, potentially from a variety of vendors, are used in one or more stages of the lifecycle.\\n\\n\\n== Stages of DevOps ==\\n\\n\\n=== Plan ===\\nPlan is composed of two things: \"define\" and \"plan\". This activity refers to the business value and application requirements. Specifically \"Plan\" activities include:\\n\\nProduction metrics, objects and feedback\\nRequirements\\nBusiness metrics\\nUpdate release metrics\\nRelease plan, timing and business case\\nSecurity policy and requirement\\nA combination of the IT personnel will be involved in these activities: business application owners, software development, software architects, continual release management, security officers and the organization responsible for managing the production of IT infrastructure.\\n\\n\\n=== Create ===\\nCreate is composed of the building, coding, and configuring of the software development process. The specific activities are:\\n\\nDesign of the software and configuration\\nCoding including code quality and performance\\nSoftware build and build performance\\nRelease candidate\\nTools and vendors in this category often overlap with other categories. Because DevOps is about breaking down silos, this is reflective in the activities and product solutions.\\n\\n\\n=== Verify ===\\nVerify is directly associated with ensuring the quality of the software release; activities designed to ensure code quality is maintained and the highest quality is deployed to production.  The main activities in this are:\\n\\nAcceptance testing\\nRegression testing\\nSecurity and vulnerability analysis\\nPerformance\\nConfiguration testing\\nSolutions for verify related activities generally fall under four main categories: Test automation, Static analysis, Test Lab, and Security.\\n\\n\\n=== Package ===\\nPackage refers to the activities involved once the release is ready for deployment, often also referred to as staging or Preproduction / \"preprod\". This often includes tasks and activities such as:\\n\\nApproval/preapprovals\\nPackage configuration\\nTriggered releases\\nRelease staging and holding\\n\\n\\n=== Release ===\\nRelease related activities include schedule, orchestration, provisioning and deploying software into production and targeted environment. The specific Release activities include:\\n\\nRelease coordination\\nDeploying and promoting applications\\nFallbacks and recovery\\nScheduled/timed releases\\nSolutions that cover this aspect of the toolchain include application release automation, deployment automation and release management.\\n\\n\\n=== Configure ===\\nConfigure activities fall under the operation side of DevOps. Once software is deployed, there may be additional IT infrastructure provisioning and configuration activities required. \\nSpecific activities including:\\n\\nInfrastructure storage, database and network provisioning and configuring\\nApplication provision and configuration.\\nThe main types of solutions that facilitate these activities are continuous configuration automation, configuration management, and infrastructure as code tools. \\n\\n\\n=== Monitor ===\\nMonitoring is an important link in a DevOps toolchain.

Build automation is a best practice itself.Continuous integration—the practice of frequently integrating one\\'s new or changed code with the existing code repository —should occur frequently enough that no intervening window remains between commit and build, and such that no errors can arise without developers noticing them and correcting them immediately. Normal practice is to trigger these builds by every commit to a repository, rather than a periodically scheduled build. The practicalities of doing this in a multi-developer environment of rapid commits are such that it is usual to trigger a short time after each commit, then to start a build when either this timer expires or after a rather longer interval since the last build. Note that since each new commit resets the timer used for the short time trigger, this is the same technique used in many button debouncing algorithms. In this way, the commit events are \"debounced\" to prevent unnecessary builds between a series of rapid-fire commits. Many automated tools offer this scheduling automatically.\\nAnother factor is the need for a version control system that supports atomic commits; i.e., all of a developer\\'s changes may be seen as a single commit operation. There is no point in trying to build from only half of the changed files.\\nTo achieve these objectives, continuous integration relies on the following principles.\\n\\n\\n=== Maintain a code repository ===\\n\\nThis practice advocates the use of a revision control system for the project\\'s source code. All artifacts required to build the project should be placed in the repository. In this practice and the revision control community, the convention is that the system should be buildable from a fresh checkout and not require additional dependencies. Extreme Programming advocate Martin Fowler also mentions that where branching is supported by tools, its use should be minimised. Instead, it is preferred for changes to be integrated rather than for multiple versions of the software to be maintained simultaneously. The mainline (or trunk) should be the place for the working version of the software.\\n\\n\\n=== Automate the build ===\\n\\nA single command should have the capability of building the system. Many build tools, which have existed for many years like make, and other more recent tools are frequently used in continuous integration environments to automate building. (E.g. Makefile, which contains a set of rules for building software, can be used automate the make build process.) Automation of the build should include automating the integration, which often includes deployment into a production-like environment. In many cases, the build script not only compiles binaries but also generates documentation, website pages, statistics and distribution media (such as Debian DEB, Red Hat RPM or Windows MSI files).\\n\\n\\n=== Make the build self-testing ===\\nOnce the code is built, all tests should run to confirm that it behaves as the developers expect it to behave.\\n\\n\\n=== Everyone commits to the baseline every day ===\\nBy committing regularly, every committer can reduce the number of conflicting changes. Checking in a week\\'s worth of work runs the risk of conflicting with other features and can be very difficult to resolve. Early, small conflicts in an area of the system cause team members to communicate about the change they are making. Committing all changes at least once a day (once per feature built) is generally considered part of the definition of Continuous Integration. In addition, performing a nightly build is generally recommended. These are l', 'Continuous integration\\n\\nIn software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers\\' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Nowadays it is typically implemented in such a way that it triggers an automated build with testing.

Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of CI and did advocate integrating more than once per day – perhaps as many as tens of times per day.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers\\' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.

Grady Booch first proposed the term CI in his 1991 method, although he did not advocate integrating several times a day. Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of CI and did advocate integrating more than once per day – perhaps as many as tens of times per day.\\n\\n\\n== Rationale ==\\nWhen embarking on a change, a developer takes a copy of the current code base on which to work. As other developers submit changed code to the source code repository, this copy gradually ceases to reflect the repository code. Not only can the existing code base change, but new code can be added as well as new libraries, and other resources that create dependencies, and potential conflicts.\\nThe longer development continues on a branch without merging back to the mainline, the greater the risk of multiple integration conflicts and failures when the developer branch is eventually merged back. When developers submit code to the repository they must first update their code to reflect the changes in the repository since they took their copy. The more changes the repository contains, the more work developers must do before submitting their own changes.\\nEventually, the repository may become so different from the developers\\' baselines that they enter what is sometimes referred to as \"merge hell\", or \"integration hell\", where the time it takes to integrate exceeds the time it took to make their original changes.\\n\\n\\n== Workflows ==\\n\\n\\n=== Run tests locally ===\\nCI should be used in combination with automated unit tests such as those written through the practices of test-driven development. All unit tests in the developer\\'s local environment should be run and passed before committing to the mainline. This helps prevent one developer\\'s work-in-progress from breaking another developer\\'s copy. Where necessary, incomplete features can be disabled before committing, using feature toggles, for instance.\\n\\n\\n=== Compile the mainline periodically; run tests of the mainline and/or use continuous quality control ===\\nA build server compiles the code periodically. The build server may automatically run tests and/or implement other continuous quality control processes. Such processes aim to improve software quality and delivery time by periodically running additional static analyses, measuring performance, extracting documentation from the source code, and facilitating manual QA processes.\\n\\n\\n=== Use CI as part of continuous delivery or continuous deployment ===\\nCI is often intertwined with continuous delivery or continuous deployment in what is called a CI/CD pipeline. \"Continuous delivery\" ensures the software checked in on the mainline is always in a state that can be deployed to users, while \"continuous deployment\" fully automates the deployment process.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe earliest known work on continuous integration was the Infuse environment developed by G. E. Kaiser, D. E. Perry, and W. M. Schell.In 1994, Grady Booch used the phrase continuous integration in Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications (2nd edition) to explain how, when developing using micro processes, \"internal releases represent a sort of continuous integration of the system, and exist to force closure of the micro process\".\\nIn 1997, Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries invented extreme programming (XP) while on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System project, including continuous integration. Beck published about continuous integration in 1998, emphasising the importance of face-to-face communication over technological support. In 1999, Beck elaborated more in his first full book on Extreme Programming. CruiseControl, one of the first open-source CI tools, was released in 2001.\\nIn 2010, Timothy Fitz published an article detailing how IMVU\\'s engineering team had built and been using the first practical CI system. While his post was originally met with scepticism, it quickly caught on and found widespread adoption as part of the Lean software development methodology, also based on IMVU.'], 'uris': None, 'data': None}\n",

A number of tools and models are commonly used in software development, such as integrated development environment (IDE), version control, computer-aided software engineering, and software documentation.\\n\\n\\n== Methodologies ==\\n\\nEach of the available methodologies are best suited to specific kinds of projects, based on various technical, organizational, project, and team considerations.\\n\\nThe simplest methodology is the \"code and fix\", typically used by a single programmer working on a small project. After briefly considering the purpose of the program, the programmer codes it and runs it to see if it works. When they are done, the product is released. This methodology is useful for prototypes but cannot be used for more elaborate programs.\\nIn the top-down waterfall model, feasibility, analysis, design, development, quality assurance, and implementation occur sequentially in that order. This model requires one step to be complete before the next begins, causing delays, and makes it impossible to revise previous steps if necessary.\\nWith iterative processes these steps are interleaved with each other for improved flexibility, efficiency, and more realistic scheduling. Instead of completing the project all at once, one might go through most of the steps with one component at a time. Iterative development also lets developers prioritize the most important features, enabling lower priority ones to be dropped later on if necessary. Agile is one popular method, originally intended for small or medium sized projects, that focuses on giving developers more control over the features that they work on to reduce the risk of time or cost overruns. Derivatives of agile include extreme programming and Scrum. Open-source software development typically uses agile methodology with concurrent design, coding, and testing, due to reliance on a distributed network of volunteer contributors.\\nBeyond agile, some companies integrate information technology (IT) operations with software development, which is called DevOps or DevSecOps including computer security. DevOps includes continuous development, testing, integration of new code in the version control system, deployment of the new code, and sometimes delivery of the code to clients. The purpose of this integration is to deliver IT services more quickly and efficiently.\\nAnother focus in many programming methodologies is the idea of trying to catch issues such as security vulnerabilities and bugs as early as possible (shift-left testing) to reduce the cost of tracking and fixing them.\\nIn 2009, it was estimated that 32 percent of software projects were delivered on time and budget, and with the full functionality. An additional 44 percent were delivered, but missing at least one of these features. The remaining 24 percent were cancelled prior to release.\\n\\n\\n== Steps ==\\nSoftware development life cycle refers to the systematic process of developing applications.', \"=== Feasibility ===\\nThe sources of ideas for software products are plentiful. These ideas can come from market research including the demographics of potential new customers, existing customers, sales prospects who rejected the product, other internal software development staff, or a creative third party. Ideas for software products are usually first evaluated by marketing personnel for economic feasibility, fit with existing channels of distribution, possible effects on existing product lines, required features, and fit with the company's marketing objectives. In the marketing evaluation phase, the cost and time assumptions become evaluated. The feasibility analysis estimates the project's return on investment, its development cost and timeframe. Based on this analysis, the company can make a business decision to invest in further development. After deciding to develop the software, the company is focused on delivering the product at or below the estimated cost and time, and with a high standard of quality (i.e., lack of bugs) and the desired functionality. Nevertheless, most software projects run late and sometimes compromises are made in features or quality to meet a deadline. \\n\\n\\n=== Analysis ===\\nSoftware analysis begins with a requirements analysis to capture the business needs of the software. Challenges for the identification of needs are that current or potential users may have different and incompatible needs, may not understand their own needs, and change their needs during the process of software development. Ultimately, the result of analysis is a detailed specification for the product that developers can work from. Software analysts often decompose the project into smaller objects, components that can be reused for increased cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and reliability. Decomposing the project may enable a multi-threaded implementation that runs significantly faster on multiprocessor computers.\\nDuring the analysis and design phases of software development, structured analysis is often used to break down the customer's requirements into pieces that can be implemented by software programmers. The underlying logic of the program may be represented in data-flow diagrams, data dictionaries, pseudocode, state transition diagrams, and/or entity relationship diagrams. If the project incorporates a piece of legacy software that has not been modeled, this software may be modeled to help ensure it is correctly incorporated with the newer software.\\n\\n\\n=== Design ===\\n\\nDesign involves choices about the implementation of the software, such as which programming languages and database software to use, or how the hardware and network communications will be organized. Design may be iterative with users consulted about their needs in a process of trial and error. Design often involves people expert in aspect such as database design, screen architecture, and the performance of servers and other hardware. Designers often attempt to find patterns in the software's functionality to spin off distinct modules that can be reused with object-oriented programming. An example of this is the model–view–controller, an interface between a graphical user interface and the backend.\\n\\n\\n=== Programming ===\\n\\nThe central feature of software development is creating and understanding the software that implements the desired functionality. There are various strategies for writing the code. Cohesive software has various components that are independent from each other. Coupling is the interrelation of different software components, which is viewed as undesirable because it increases the difficulty of maintenance. Often, software programmers do not follow industry best practices, resulting in code that is inefficient, difficult to understand, or lacking documentation on its functionality. These standards are especially likely to break down in the presence of deadlines. As a result, testing, debugging, and revising the code becomes much more difficult. Code refactoring, for example adding more comments to the code, is a solution to improve the understandibility of code.\\n\\n\\n=== Testing ===\"], 'uris': None, 'data': None}\n",

The product owner liaises with stakeholders, those who have interest in the project's outcome, to communicate tasks and expectations with developers. Developers in a scrum team organize work by themselves, with the facilitation of a scrum master. Scrum teams, ideally, should abide by the five values of scrum: commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect.\\n\\n\\n=== Product owner ===\\nEach scrum team has one product owner. The product owner focuses on the business side of product development and spends the majority of time liaising with stakeholders and the team. The role is intended to primarily represent the product's stakeholders, the voice of the customer, or the desires of a committee, and bears responsibility for the delivery of business results. Product owners manage the product backlog, which is essentially the project's running to-do list, and are responsible for maximizing the value that a team delivers. They do not dictate the technical solutions of a team but may instead attempt to seek consensus among team members.As the primary liaison of the scrum team towards stakeholders, product owners are responsible for communicating announcements, project definitions and progress, RIDAs (risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions), funding and scheduling changes, the product backlog, and project governance, among other responsibilities. Product owners can also cancel a sprint if necessary, without the input of team members.\\n\\n\\n=== Developers ===\\nIn scrum, the term developer or team member refers to anyone who plays a role in the development and support of the product and can include researchers, architects, designers, programmers, etc.\\n\\n\\n=== Scrum master ===\\nScrum is facilitated by a scrum master, whose role is to educate and coach teams about scrum theory and practice. Scrum masters have differing roles and responsibilities from traditional team leads or project managers. Some scrum master responsibilities include coaching, objective setting, problem solving, oversight, planning, backlog management, and communication facilitation. On the other hand, traditional project managers often have people management responsibilities, which a scrum master does not. Scrum teams do not involve project managers, so as to maximize self-organisation among developers.\\n\\n\\n== Workflow ==\\n\\n\\n=== Sprint ===\\n\\nA sprint (also known as an iteration, timebox or design sprint) is a fixed period of time wherein team members work on a specific goal. Each sprint is normally between one week and one month, with two weeks being the most common. Usually, daily meetings are held to discuss the progress of the project undertaken as well as difficulties faced by team members. The outcome of the sprint is a functional deliverable, or a product which has received some development in increments. \\nWhen a sprint is abnormally terminated, the next step is to conduct new sprint planning, where the reason for the termination is reviewed.\\nEach sprint starts with a sprint planning event in which a sprint goal is defined. Priorities for planned sprints are chosen out of the backlog. Each sprint ends with two events:\\nA sprint review (progress shown to stakeholders to elicit their feedback)\\nA sprint retrospective (identify lessons and improvements for the next sprints)Scrum emphasizes actionable output at the end of each sprint, which brings the developed product closer to market success.\\n\\n\\n=== Sprint planning ===\\nAt the beginning of a sprint, the scrum team holds a sprint planning event to:\\n\\nAgree on the sprint goal, that is, what they intend to deliver by sprint end\\nIdentifying product backlog items that contribute towards this goal\\nForm a sprint backlog by selecting which identified items should be completed in the sprintThe suggested maximum duration of sprint planning is eight hours for a four-week sprint.\\n\\n\\n=== Daily scrum ===\\n\\nEach day during a sprint, the developers hold a daily scrum (often conducted standing up) with specific guidelines, and which may be facilitated by a scrum master. Daily scrum meetings are intended to be less than 15 minutes in length, taking place at the same time and location daily. The purpose of the meeting is to announce progress made towards the sprint goal and issues that may be hindering the goal, without going into any detailed discussion. Once over, individual members can go into a 'breakout session' or an 'after party' for extended discussion and collaboration. Scrum masters are responsible for ensuring that team members use daily scrums effectively, or, if team members are unabl\", 'Scrum (software development)\\n\\nScrum is an agile team collaboration framework commonly used in software development and other industries. \\nScrum prescribes for teams to break work into goals to be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints.

The flexible and semi-unplanned approach of scrum is based in part on the notion of requirements volatility, that stakeholders will change their requirements as the project evolves.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe use of the term scrum in software development came from a 1986 Harvard Business Review paper titled \"The New New Product Development Game\" by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka. Based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier, and printer industries, the authors outlined a new approach to product development for increased speed and flexibility. They called this the rugby approach, as the process involves a single cross-functional team operating across multiple overlapping phases, in which the team \"tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth\". The authors later developed scrum in their book, The Knowledge Creating Company.In the early 1990s, Ken Schwaber used what would become scrum at his company, Advanced Development Methods. Jeff Sutherland, John Scumniotales, and Jeff McKenna developed a similar approach at Easel Corporation, referring to the approach with the term scrum. Sutherland and Schwaber later worked together to integrate their ideas into a single framework, formally known as scrum. Schwaber and Sutherland tested scrum and continually improved it, leading to the publication of a research paper in 1995, and the Manifesto for Agile Software Development in 2001. Schwaber also collaborated with Babatunde Ogunnaike at DuPont Research Station and the University of Delaware to develop Scrum. Ogunnaike believed that software development projects could often fail when initial conditions change, if the product management was not rooted in empirical practice.In 2002, Schwaber with others founded the Scrum Alliance and set up the Certified Scrum accreditation series. Schwaber left the Scrum Alliance in late 2009 and subsequently founded Scrum.org which oversees the parallel Professional Scrum accreditation series. Since 2009, a public document called The Scrum Guide has been published and updated by Schwaber and Sutherland. It has been revised 6 times, with the current version being November 2020.'], 'uris': None, 'data': None}\n",

As documented in their Manifesto for Agile Software Development the practitioners value: \\n\\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\\nResponding to change over following a plan\\nThe practitioners cite inspiration from new practices at the time including extreme programming, scrum, dynamic systems development method, adaptive software development and being sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes. \\nMany software development practices emerged from the agile mindset. These agile-based practices, sometimes called Agile (with a capital A) include requirements, discovery and solutions improvement through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams with their customer(s)/end user(s).\\nWhile there is much anecdotal evidence that the agile mindset and agile-based practices improve the software development process, the empirical evidence is limited and less than conclusive.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Agile software development'}, {'categories': \"['Agile software development', 'All articles with unsourced statements',

These lightweight methods included: rapid application development (RAD), from 1991; the unified process (UP) and dynamic systems development method (DSDM), both from 1994; Scrum, from 1995; Crystal Clear and extreme programming (XP), both from 1996; and feature-driven development (FDD), from 1997. Although these all originated before the publication of the Agile Manifesto, they are now collectively referred to as agile software development methods.\\nAlready since 1991 similar changes had been underway in manufacturing and management thinking derived from Lean management.\\nIn 2001, seventeen software developers met at a resort in Snowbird, Utah to discuss lightweight development methods. They were: Kent Beck (Extreme Programming), Ward Cunningham (Extreme Programming), Dave Thomas (PragProg, Ruby), Jeff Sutherland (Scrum), Ken Schwaber (Scrum), Jim Highsmith (Adaptive Software Development), Alistair Cockburn (Crystal), Robert C. Martin (SOLID), Mike Beedle (Scrum), Arie van Bennekum, Martin Fowler (OOAD and UML), James Grenning, Andrew Hunt (PragProg, Ruby), Ron Jeffries (Extreme Programming), Jon Kern, Brian Marick (Ruby, TDD), and Steve Mellor (OOA). The group, The Agile Alliance, published the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.\\nIn 2005, a group headed by Cockburn and Highsmith wrote an addendum of project management principles, the PM Declaration of Interdependence, to guide software project management according to agile software development methods.\\nIn 2009, a group working with Martin wrote an extension of software development principles, the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto, to guide agile software development according to professional conduct and mastery.\\nIn 2011, the Agile Alliance created the Guide to Agile Practices (renamed the Agile Glossary in 2016), an evolving open-source compendium of the working definitions of agile practices, terms, and elements, along with interpretations and experience guidelines from the worldwide community of agile practitioners.\\n\\n\\n== Mindset ==\\n\\n\\n=== Values ===\\nThe agile manifesto reads :\\nWe are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:', 'Individuals and interactions over processes and tools \\n  Working software over comprehensive documentation \\n  Customer collaboration over contract negotiation \\n  Responding to change over following a plan \\nThat is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.\\nScott Ambler explained:\\n\\nTools and processes are important, but it is more important to have competent people working together effectively.\\nGood documentation is useful in helping people to understand how the software is built and how to use it, but the main point of development is to create software, not documentation.\\nA contract is important but is no substitute for working closely with customers to discover what they need.\\nA project plan is important, but it must not be too rigid to accommodate changes in technology or the environment, stakeholders\\' priorities, and people\\'s understanding of the problem and its solution.\\nIntroducing the manifesto on behalf of the Agile Alliance, Jim Highsmith said,\\n\\nThe Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology. We want to restore a balance. We embrace modeling, but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository. We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes. We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment. Those who would brand proponents of XP or SCRUM or any of the other Agile Methodologies as \"hackers\" are ignorant of both the methodologies and the original definition of the term hacker.\\n\\n\\n=== Principles ===\\nThe values are based on these principles:\\n\\nCustomer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\\nWelcome changing requirements, even in late development.\\nDeliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).\\nClose, daily cooperation between business people and developers.\\nProjects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.\\nFace-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).\\nWorking software is the primary measure of progress.\\nSustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.\\nContinuous attention to technical excellence and good design.\\nSimplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.\\nBest architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.\\nRegularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\n\\n\\n=== Iterative, incremental, and evolutionary ===\\nMost agile development methods break product development work into small increments that minimize the amount of up-front planning and design. Iterations, or sprints, are short time frames (timeboxes) that typically last from one to four weeks.:\\u200a20\\u200a Each iteration involves a cross-functional team working in all functions: planning, analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing. At the end of the iteration a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders. This minimizes overall risk and allows the product to adapt to changes quickly. An iteration might not add enough functionality to warrant a market release, but the goal is to have an available release (with minimal bugs) at the end of each iteration. Through incremental development, products have room to \"fail often and early\" throughout each iterative phase instead of drastically on a final release date. Multiple iterations might be required to release a product or new features. Working software is the primary measure of progress.\\nA key advantage of agile approaches is speed to market and risk mitigation.

Containerization, also referred as container stuffing or container loading, is the process of unitization of cargoes in exports. Containerization is the predominant form of unitization of export cargoes, as opposed to other systems such as the barge system or palletization. The containers have standardized dimensions. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—container ships, rail transport flatcars, and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The handling system is mechanized so that all handling is done with cranes and special forklift trucks. All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems.\\nContainerization originated several centuries ago but was not well developed or widely applied until afte\\n\\n### Containerization (computing)\\n\\nSummary: In software engineering, containerization is operating system-level virtualization or application-level virtualization over multiple network resources so that software applications can run in isolated user spaces called containers in any cloud or non-cloud environment, regardless of type or vendor.\\n\\nRelated\\nAll stub articles- Articles with short description- CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list- CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list- Cloud computing- Computing stubs- Short description matches Wikidata\\n\\n### Containerized housing unit\\n\\nSummary: A containerized housing unit, usually abbreviated as CHU (and sometimes called containerized living unit or CLU) is an ISO shipping container pre-fabricated into a living quarters. Such containers can be transported by container ships, railroad cars, planes, and trucks that are capable of transporting intermodal freight transport cargo.\\nContainer housing units are related to the site and land occupied during a certain amount of time by the need of water supply and excavation, electricity, telecommunications, etc. Plug-in city is a concept that is developing as more units capable of moving by intermodal means are brought up to the market. Local site is thus of most importance on correct container housing units use.  An example of CLU housing is at the Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa base (Camp Lemonnier) in Djibouti.\\nModular shipping containers are typically referred to as isotainers.

Programming and maintaining the source code is the central step of this process, but it also includes conceiving the project, evaluating its feasibility, analyzing the business requirements, software design, testing, to release.  Software engineering, in addition to development, also includes \\nproject management, employee management, and other overhead functions. Software development may be sequential, in which each step is complete before the next begins, but iterative development methods where multiple steps can be executed at once and earlier steps can be revisited have also been devised to improve flexibility, efficiency, and scheduling.\\nSoftware development involves professionals from various fields, not just software programmers but also individuals specialized in testing, documentation writing, graphic design, user support, marketing, and fundraising. A number of tools and models are \\n\\n### Scrum (software development)\\n\\nSummary: Scrum is an agile team collaboration framework commonly used in software development and other industries. \\nScrum prescribes for teams to break work into goals to be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints. Each sprint is no longer than one month and commonly lasts two weeks. The scrum team assesses progress in time-boxed, stand-up meetings of up to 15 minutes, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: one sprint review to demonstrate the work for stakeholders and solicit feedback, and one internal sprint retrospective. A person in charge of a scrum team is typically called a scrum master.\\nScrum\\'s approach to product development involves bringing decision-making authority to an operational level. Unlike a sequential approach to product development, scrum is an iterative and incremental framework for product development. Scrum allows for continuous feedback and flexibility, requiring team\\n\\n### Agile software development\\n\\nSummary: Agile software development is the mindset for developing software that derives from values agreed upon by The Agile Alliance, a group of 17 software practitioners in 2001. As documented in their Manifesto for Agile Software Development the practitioners value: \\n\\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\\nResponding to change over following a plan\\nThe practitioners cite inspiration from new practices at the time including extreme programming, scrum, dynamic systems development method, adaptive software development and being sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes. \\nMany software development practices emerged from the agile mindset. These agile-based practices, sometimes called Agile (with a capital A) include requirements, discovery and solutions improvement through th\\n\\n### Virtualization\\n\\nSummary: In computing, virtualization or virtualisation in British English (sometimes abbreviated v12n, a numeronym) is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something at the same abstraction level, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.\\nVirtualization began in the 1960s, as a method of logically dividing the system resources provided by mainframe computers between different applications. An early and successful example is IBM CP/CMS. The control program CP provided each user with a simulated stand-alone System/360 computer. Since then, the meaning of the term has broadened.\\nPopular examples of virtualization software includes VirtualBox and VMware Workstation Player.\\n\\nRelated\\n[- \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - u- n- s- o- u- r- c- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - N- K- C-  - i- d- e- n- t- i- f- i- e- \\n\\n### X86 virtualization\\n\\nSummary: x86 virtualization is the use of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities on an x86/x86-64 CPU.\\nIn the late 1990s x86 virtualization was achieved by complex software techniques, necessary to compensate for the processor\\'s lack of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities while attaining reasonable performance. In 2005 and 2006, both Intel (VT-x) and AMD (AMD-V) introduced limited hardware virtualization support that allowed simpler virtualization software but offered very few speed benefits. Greater hardware support, which allowed substantial speed improvements, came with later processor models.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\n[- \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - c- o- n- t- a- i- n- i- n- g-  - p- o- t- e- n- t- i- a- l- l- y-  - d- a- t- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - u- n- s- o- u- r- c- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - c- o- n- t- a- i-\\n\\n### Virtual machine\\n\\nSummary: In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is the virtualization or emulation of a computer system.  Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide the functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of the two.\\nVirtual machines differ and are organized by their function, shown here:\\n\\nSystem virtual machines (also called full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide the functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments that are isolated from one another yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, with virtualization-specific hardware features on the host CPUs providing assistance to hypervisors.\\nProcess virtual machines are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-indepen', 'interview_config': None, 'perspectives': {'editors': [{'name': 'John Doe', 'role': 'Lead Editor', 'affiliation': 'University of ABC', 'description': 'Specializes in environmental science.'}, {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'role': 'Editor', 'affiliation': 'Company XYZ', 'description': 'Focuses on technology trends.'}]}, 'conversations': [{'context': 'Increase development productivity by using Docker compose and local docker labs', 'interview_config': None, 'editor': {'name': 'John Doe', 'role': 'Lead Editor', 'affiliation': 'University of ABC', 'description': 'Specializes in environmental science.'}, 'messages': [], 'references': {}}, {'context': 'Increase development productivity by using Docker compose and local docker labs', 'interview_config': None, 'editor': {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'role': 'Editor', 'affiliation': 'Company XYZ', 'description': 'Focuses on technology trends.'}, 'messages': [], 'references': {}}], 'article': None}\n",

Containerization, also referred as container stuffing or container loading, is the process of unitization of cargoes in exports. Containerization is the predominant form of unitization of export cargoes, as opposed to other systems such as the barge system or palletization. The containers have standardized dimensions. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—container ships, rail transport flatcars, and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The handling system is mechanized so that all handling is done with cranes and special forklift trucks. All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems.\\nContainerization originated several centuries ago but was not well developed or widely applied until afte\\n\\n### Containerization (computing)\\n\\nSummary: In software engineering, containerization is operating system-level virtualization or application-level virtualization over multiple network resources so that software applications can run in isolated user spaces called containers in any cloud or non-cloud environment, regardless of type or vendor.\\n\\nRelated\\nAll stub articles- Articles with short description- CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list- CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list- Cloud computing- Computing stubs- Short description matches Wikidata\\n\\n### Containerized housing unit\\n\\nSummary: A containerized housing unit, usually abbreviated as CHU (and sometimes called containerized living unit or CLU) is an ISO shipping container pre-fabricated into a living quarters. Such containers can be transported by container ships, railroad cars, planes, and trucks that are capable of transporting intermodal freight transport cargo.\\nContainer housing units are related to the site and land occupied during a certain amount of time by the need of water supply and excavation, electricity, telecommunications, etc. Plug-in city is a concept that is developing as more units capable of moving by intermodal means are brought up to the market. Local site is thus of most importance on correct container housing units use.  An example of CLU housing is at the Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa base (Camp Lemonnier) in Djibouti.\\nModular shipping containers are typically referred to as isotainers. In some military applications, the slang terms \"Co\\n\\n### DevOps\\n\\nSummary: DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle. DevOps is complementary to agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the agile way of working.\\n\\nRelated\\nAgile software development- Articles with short description- CS1 errors: missing periodical- CS1 maint: location missing publisher- Information technology management- Short description is different from Wikidata- Software development- Software development process- Wikipedia pending changes protected pages\\n\\n### Azure DevOps Server\\n\\nSummary: Azure DevOps Server, formerly known as Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Visual Studio Team System (VSTS), is a Microsoft product that provides version control (either with Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) or Git), reporting, requirements management, project management (for both agile software development and waterfall teams), automated builds, testing and release management capabilities. It covers the entire application lifecycle and enables DevOps capabilities. Azure DevOps can be used as a back-end to numerous integrated development environments (IDEs) but is tailored for Microsoft Visual Studio and Eclipse on all platforms.\\n\\nRelated\\nAgile software development- Articles with short description- Bug and issue tracking software- Build automation- Code search engines- Collaborative software- Continuous integration- Distributed bug tracking systems- Java development tools- Load testing tools- Microsoft Visual Studio- Project hosting websites- Projec\\n\\n### DevOps toolchain\\n\\nSummary: A DevOps toolchain is a set or combination of tools that aid in the delivery, development, and management of software applications throughout the systems development life cycle, as coordinated by an organisation that uses DevOps practices.\\nGenerally, DevOps tools fit into one or more activities, which supports specific DevOps initiatives: Plan, Create, Verify, Package, Release, Configure, Monitor, and Version Control.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\nAll articles needing additional references- Articles needing additional references from January 2022- Articles with short description- Programming tools- Short description is different from Wikidata- Software design- Software development process- Wikipedia articles containing buzzwords from July 2018- Wikipedia articles needing clarification from July 2018\\n\\n### Continuous integration\\n\\nSummary: In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all developers\\' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Nowadays it is typically implemented in such a way that it triggers an automated build with testing. Grady Booch first proposed the term CI in his 1991 method, although he did not advocate integrating several times a day. Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of CI and did advocate integrating more than once per day – perhaps as many as tens of times per day.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\nAccuracy disputes from May 2020- Agile software development- All Wikipedia neutral point of view disputes- All accuracy disputes- All articles lacking in-text citations- All articles needing additional references- All articles to be expanded- All articles with unsourced statements- All pages needing cleanup- Articles containing how-to sections- Articles lacking in-text citations from July 2016- Articles needing additional refe\\n\\n### Comparison of continuous integration software\\n\\nSummary: This is a compendium of continuous integration software that supports a software engineering practice, continuous integration, in which developers\\' changes are immediately tested and reported when they are added to the mainline code base.

Programming and maintaining the source code is the central step of this process, but it also includes conceiving the project, evaluating its feasibility, analyzing the business requirements, software design, testing, to release.  Software engineering, in addition to development, also includes \\nproject management, employee management, and other overhead functions. Software development may be sequential, in which each step is complete before the next begins, but iterative development methods where multiple steps can be executed at once and earlier steps can be revisited have also been devised to improve flexibility, efficiency, and scheduling.\\nSoftware development involves professionals from various fields, not just software programmers but also individuals specialized in testing, documentation writing, graphic design, user support, marketing, and fundraising. A number of tools and models are \\n\\n### Scrum (software development)\\n\\nSummary: Scrum is an agile team collaboration framework commonly used in software development and other industries. \\nScrum prescribes for teams to break work into goals to be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints. Each sprint is no longer than one month and commonly lasts two weeks. The scrum team assesses progress in time-boxed, stand-up meetings of up to 15 minutes, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: one sprint review to demonstrate the work for stakeholders and solicit feedback, and one internal sprint retrospective. A person in charge of a scrum team is typically called a scrum master.\\nScrum\\'s approach to product development involves bringing decision-making authority to an operational level. Unlike a sequential approach to product development, scrum is an iterative and incremental framework for product development. Scrum allows for continuous feedback and flexibility, requiring team\\n\\n### Agile software development\\n\\nSummary: Agile software development is the mindset for developing software that derives from values agreed upon by The Agile Alliance, a group of 17 software practitioners in 2001. As documented in their Manifesto for Agile Software Development the practitioners value: \\n\\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\\nResponding to change over following a plan\\nThe practitioners cite inspiration from new practices at the time including extreme programming, scrum, dynamic systems development method, adaptive software development and being sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes. \\nMany software development practices emerged from the agile mindset. These agile-based practices, sometimes called Agile (with a capital A) include requirements, discovery and solutions improvement through th\\n\\n### Virtualization\\n\\nSummary: In computing, virtualization or virtualisation in British English (sometimes abbreviated v12n, a numeronym) is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something at the same abstraction level, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.\\nVirtualization began in the 1960s, as a method of logically dividing the system resources provided by mainframe computers between different applications. An early and successful example is IBM CP/CMS. The control program CP provided each user with a simulated stand-alone System/360 computer. Since then, the meaning of the term has broadened.\\nPopular examples of virtualization software includes VirtualBox and VMware Workstation Player.\\n\\nRelated\\n[- \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - u- n- s- o- u- r- c- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - N- K- C-  - i- d- e- n- t- i- f- i- e- \\n\\n### X86 virtualization\\n\\nSummary: x86 virtualization is the use of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities on an x86/x86-64 CPU.\\nIn the late 1990s x86 virtualization was achieved by complex software techniques, necessary to compensate for the processor\\'s lack of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities while attaining reasonable performance. In 2005 and 2006, both Intel (VT-x) and AMD (AMD-V) introduced limited hardware virtualization support that allowed simpler virtualization software but offered very few speed benefits. Greater hardware support, which allowed substantial speed improvements, came with later processor models.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\n[- \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - c- o- n- t- a- i- n- i- n- g-  - p- o- t- e- n- t- i- a- l- l- y-  - d- a- t- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - u- n- s- o- u- r- c- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - c- o- n- t- a- i-\\n\\n### Virtual machine\\n\\nSummary: In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is the virtualization or emulation of a computer system.  Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide the functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of the two.\\nVirtual machines differ and are organized by their function, shown here:\\n\\nSystem virtual machines (also called full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide the functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments that are isolated from one another yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, with virtualization-specific hardware features on the host CPUs providing assistance to hypervisors.\\nProcess virtual machines are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-indepen', 'interview_config': None, 'perspectives': {'editors': [{'name': 'John Doe', 'role': 'Lead Editor', 'affiliation': 'University of ABC', 'description': 'Specializes in environmental science.'}, {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'role': 'Editor', 'affiliation': 'Company XYZ', 'description': 'Focuses on technology trends.'}]}, 'conversations': [{'context': 'Increase development productivity by using Docker compose and local docker labs', 'interview_config': None, 'editor': {'name': 'John Doe', 'role': 'Lead Editor', 'affiliation': 'University of ABC', 'description': 'Specializes in environmental science.'}, 'messages': [], 'references': {}}, {'context': 'Increase development productivity by using Docker compose and local docker labs', 'interview_config': None, 'editor': {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'role': 'Editor', 'affiliation': 'Company XYZ', 'description': 'Focuses on technology trends.'}, 'messages': [], 'references': {}}], 'article': None}\n",

Containerization, also referred as container stuffing or container loading, is the process of unitization of cargoes in exports. Containerization is the predominant form of unitization of export cargoes, as opposed to other systems such as the barge system or palletization. The containers have standardized dimensions. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—container ships, rail transport flatcars, and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The handling system is mechanized so that all handling is done with cranes and special forklift trucks. All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems.\\nContainerization originated several centuries ago but was not well developed or widely applied until afte\\n\\n### Containerization (computing)\\n\\nSummary: In software engineering, containerization is operating system-level virtualization or application-level virtualization over multiple network resources so that software applications can run in isolated user spaces called containers in any cloud or non-cloud environment, regardless of type or vendor.\\n\\nRelated\\nAll stub articles- Articles with short description- CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list- CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list- Cloud computing- Computing stubs- Short description matches Wikidata\\n\\n### Containerized housing unit\\n\\nSummary: A containerized housing unit, usually abbreviated as CHU (and sometimes called containerized living unit or CLU) is an ISO shipping container pre-fabricated into a living quarters. Such containers can be transported by container ships, railroad cars, planes, and trucks that are capable of transporting intermodal freight transport cargo.\\nContainer housing units are related to the site and land occupied during a certain amount of time by the need of water supply and excavation, electricity, telecommunications, etc. Plug-in city is a concept that is developing as more units capable of moving by intermodal means are brought up to the market. Local site is thus of most importance on correct container housing units use.  An example of CLU housing is at the Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa base (Camp Lemonnier) in Djibouti.\\nModular shipping containers are typically referred to as isotainers.

Programming and maintaining the source code is the central step of this process, but it also includes conceiving the project, evaluating its feasibility, analyzing the business requirements, software design, testing, to release.  Software engineering, in addition to development, also includes \\nproject management, employee management, and other overhead functions. Software development may be sequential, in which each step is complete before the next begins, but iterative development methods where multiple steps can be executed at once and earlier steps can be revisited have also been devised to improve flexibility, efficiency, and scheduling.\\nSoftware development involves professionals from various fields, not just software programmers but also individuals specialized in testing, documentation writing, graphic design, user support, marketing, and fundraising. A number of tools and models are \\n\\n### Scrum (software development)\\n\\nSummary: Scrum is an agile team collaboration framework commonly used in software development and other industries. \\nScrum prescribes for teams to break work into goals to be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints. Each sprint is no longer than one month and commonly lasts two weeks. The scrum team assesses progress in time-boxed, stand-up meetings of up to 15 minutes, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: one sprint review to demonstrate the work for stakeholders and solicit feedback, and one internal sprint retrospective. A person in charge of a scrum team is typically called a scrum master.\\nScrum\\'s approach to product development involves bringing decision-making authority to an operational level. Unlike a sequential approach to product development, scrum is an iterative and incremental framework for product development. Scrum allows for continuous feedback and flexibility, requiring team\\n\\n### Agile software development\\n\\nSummary: Agile software development is the mindset for developing software that derives from values agreed upon by The Agile Alliance, a group of 17 software practitioners in 2001. As documented in their Manifesto for Agile Software Development the practitioners value: \\n\\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\\nResponding to change over following a plan\\nThe practitioners cite inspiration from new practices at the time including extreme programming, scrum, dynamic systems development method, adaptive software development and being sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes. \\nMany software development practices emerged from the agile mindset. These agile-based practices, sometimes called Agile (with a capital A) include requirements, discovery and solutions improvement through th\\n\\n### Virtualization\\n\\nSummary: In computing, virtualization or virtualisation in British English (sometimes abbreviated v12n, a numeronym) is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something at the same abstraction level, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.\\nVirtualization began in the 1960s, as a method of logically dividing the system resources provided by mainframe computers between different applications. An early and successful example is IBM CP/CMS. The control program CP provided each user with a simulated stand-alone System/360 computer. Since then, the meaning of the term has broadened.\\nPopular examples of virtualization software includes VirtualBox and VMware Workstation Player.\\n\\nRelated\\n[- \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - u- n- s- o- u- r- c- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - N- K- C-  - i- d- e- n- t- i- f- i- e- \\n\\n### X86 virtualization\\n\\nSummary: x86 virtualization is the use of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities on an x86/x86-64 CPU.\\nIn the late 1990s x86 virtualization was achieved by complex software techniques, necessary to compensate for the processor\\'s lack of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities while attaining reasonable performance. In 2005 and 2006, both Intel (VT-x) and AMD (AMD-V) introduced limited hardware virtualization support that allowed simpler virtualization software but offered very few speed benefits. Greater hardware support, which allowed substantial speed improvements, came with later processor models.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\n[- \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - c- o- n- t- a- i- n- i- n- g-  - p- o- t- e- n- t- i- a- l- l- y-  - d- a- t- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - u- n- s- o- u- r- c- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - c- o- n- t- a- i-\\n\\n### Virtual machine\\n\\nSummary: In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is the virtualization or emulation of a computer system.  Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide the functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of the two.\\nVirtual machines differ and are organized by their function, shown here:\\n\\nSystem virtual machines (also called full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide the functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments that are isolated from one another yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, with virtualization-specific hardware features on the host CPUs providing assistance to hypervisors.\\nProcess virtual machines are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-indepen', 'interview_config': None, 'perspectives': {'editors': [{'name': 'John Doe', 'role': 'Lead Editor', 'affiliation': 'University of ABC', 'description': 'Specializes in environmental science.'}, {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'role': 'Editor', 'affiliation': 'Company XYZ', 'description': 'Focuses on technology trends.'}]}, 'conversations': [{'context': 'Increase development productivity by using Docker compose and local docker labs', 'interview_config': None, 'editor': {'name': 'John Doe', 'role': 'Lead Editor', 'affiliation': 'University of ABC', 'description': 'Specializes in environmental science.'}, 'messages': [], 'references': {}}, {'context': 'Increase development productivity by using Docker compose and local docker labs', 'interview_config': None, 'editor': {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'role': 'Editor', 'affiliation': 'Company XYZ', 'description': 'Focuses on technology trends.'}, 'messages': [], 'references': {}}], 'article': None}\n",

Containerization, also referred as container stuffing or container loading, is the process of unitization of cargoes in exports. Containerization is the predominant form of unitization of export cargoes, as opposed to other systems such as the barge system or palletization. The containers have standardized dimensions. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—container ships, rail transport flatcars, and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The handling system is mechanized so that all handling is done with cranes and special forklift trucks. All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems.\\nContainerization originated several centuries ago but was not well developed or widely applied until afte\\n\\n### Containerization (computing)\\n\\nSummary: In software engineering, containerization is operating system-level virtualization or application-level virtualization over multiple network resources so that software applications can run in isolated user spaces called containers in any cloud or non-cloud environment, regardless of type or vendor.\\n\\nRelated\\nAll stub articles- Articles with short description- CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list- CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list- Cloud computing- Computing stubs- Short description matches Wikidata\\n\\n### Containerized housing unit\\n\\nSummary: A containerized housing unit, usually abbreviated as CHU (and sometimes called containerized living unit or CLU) is an ISO shipping container pre-fabricated into a living quarters. Such containers can be transported by container ships, railroad cars, planes, and trucks that are capable of transporting intermodal freight transport cargo.\\nContainer housing units are related to the site and land occupied during a certain amount of time by the need of water supply and excavation, electricity, telecommunications, etc. Plug-in city is a concept that is developing as more units capable of moving by intermodal means are brought up to the market. Local site is thus of most importance on correct container housing units use.  An example of CLU housing is at the Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa base (Camp Lemonnier) in Djibouti.\\nModular shipping containers are typically referred to as isotainers.

Nowadays it is typically implemented in such a way that it triggers an automated build with testing. Grady Booch first proposed the term CI in his 1991 method, although he did not advocate integrating several times a day. Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of CI and did advocate integrating more than once per day – perhaps as many as tens of times per day.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\nAccuracy disputes from May 2020- Agile software development- All Wikipedia neutral point of view disputes- All accuracy disputes- All articles lacking in-text citations- All articles needing additional references- All articles to be expanded- All articles with unsourced statements- All pages needing cleanup- Articles containing how-to sections- Articles lacking in-text citations from July 2016- Articles needing additional refe\\n\\n### Comparison of continuous integration software\\n\\nSummary: This is a compendium of continuous integration software that supports a software engineering practice, continuous integration, in which developers\\' changes are immediately tested and reported when they are added to the mainline code base.

Programming and maintaining the source code is the central step of this process, but it also includes conceiving the project, evaluating its feasibility, analyzing the business requirements, software design, testing, to release.  Software engineering, in addition to development, also includes \\nproject management, employee management, and other overhead functions. Software development may be sequential, in which each step is complete before the next begins, but iterative development methods where multiple steps can be executed at once and earlier steps can be revisited have also been devised to improve flexibility, efficiency, and scheduling.\\nSoftware development involves professionals from various fields, not just software programmers but also individuals specialized in testing, documentation writing, graphic design, user support, marketing, and fundraising. A number of tools and models are \\n\\n### Scrum (software development)\\n\\nSummary: Scrum is an agile team collaboration framework commonly used in software development and other industries. \\nScrum prescribes for teams to break work into goals to be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints. Each sprint is no longer than one month and commonly lasts two weeks. The scrum team assesses progress in time-boxed, stand-up meetings of up to 15 minutes, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: one sprint review to demonstrate the work for stakeholders and solicit feedback, and one internal sprint retrospective. A person in charge of a scrum team is typically called a scrum master.\\nScrum\\'s approach to product development involves bringing decision-making authority to an operational level. Unlike a sequential approach to product development, scrum is an iterative and incremental framework for product development. Scrum allows for continuous feedback and flexibility, requiring team\\n\\n### Agile software development\\n\\nSummary: Agile software development is the mindset for developing software that derives from values agreed upon by The Agile Alliance, a group of 17 software practitioners in 2001. As documented in their Manifesto for Agile Software Development the practitioners value: \\n\\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\\nResponding to change over following a plan\\nThe practitioners cite inspiration from new practices at the time including extreme programming, scrum, dynamic systems development method, adaptive software development and being sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes. \\nMany software development practices emerged from the agile mindset. These agile-based practices, sometimes called Agile (with a capital A) include requirements, discovery and solutions improvement through th\\n\\n### Virtualization\\n\\nSummary: In computing, virtualization or virtualisation in British English (sometimes abbreviated v12n, a numeronym) is the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something at the same abstraction level, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.\\nVirtualization began in the 1960s, as a method of logically dividing the system resources provided by mainframe computers between different applications. An early and successful example is IBM CP/CMS. The control program CP provided each user with a simulated stand-alone System/360 computer. Since then, the meaning of the term has broadened.\\nPopular examples of virtualization software includes VirtualBox and VMware Workstation Player.\\n\\nRelated\\n[- \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - u- n- s- o- u- r- c- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - N- K- C-  - i- d- e- n- t- i- f- i- e- \\n\\n### X86 virtualization\\n\\nSummary: x86 virtualization is the use of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities on an x86/x86-64 CPU.\\nIn the late 1990s x86 virtualization was achieved by complex software techniques, necessary to compensate for the processor\\'s lack of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities while attaining reasonable performance. In 2005 and 2006, both Intel (VT-x) and AMD (AMD-V) introduced limited hardware virtualization support that allowed simpler virtualization software but offered very few speed benefits. Greater hardware support, which allowed substantial speed improvements, came with later processor models.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\n[- \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - c- o- n- t- a- i- n- i- n- g-  - p- o- t- e- n- t- i- a- l- l- y-  - d- a- t- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - u- n- s- o- u- r- c- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - c- o- n- t- a- i-\\n\\n### Virtual machine\\n\\nSummary: In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is the virtualization or emulation of a computer system.  Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide the functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of the two.\\nVirtual machines differ and are organized by their function, shown here:\\n\\nSystem virtual machines (also called full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide the functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments that are isolated from one another yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, with virtualization-specific hardware features on the host CPUs providing assistance to hypervisors.\\nProcess virtual machines are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-indepen', 'interview_config': None, 'perspectives': {'editors': [{'name': 'John Doe', 'role': 'Lead Editor', 'affiliation': 'University of ABC', 'description': 'Specializes in environmental science.'}, {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'role': 'Editor', 'affiliation': 'Company XYZ', 'description': 'Focuses on technology trends.'}]}, 'conversations': [{'context': 'Increase development productivity by using Docker compose and local docker labs', 'interview_config': None, 'editor': {'name': 'John Doe', 'role': 'Lead Editor', 'affiliation': 'University of ABC', 'description': 'Specializes in environmental science.'}, 'messages': [], 'references': {}}, {'context': 'Increase development productivity by using Docker compose and local docker labs', 'interview_config': None, 'editor': {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'role': 'Editor', 'affiliation': 'Company XYZ', 'description': 'Focuses on technology trends.'}, 'messages': [], 'references': {}}], 'article': '# Increase Development Productivity with Docker Compose and Local Docker Labs\\n\\n## Introduction to Docker Compose\\n\\nDocker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Containerization, also referred as container stuffing or container loading, is the process of unitization of cargoes in exports. Containerization is the predominant form of unitization of export cargoes, as opposed to other systems such as the barge system or palletization. The containers have standardized dimensions. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported efficiently over long distances, and transferred from one mode of transport to another—container ships, rail transport flatcars, and semi-trailer trucks—without being opened. The handling system is mechanized so that all handling is done with cranes and special forklift trucks. All containers are numbered and tracked using computerized systems.\\nContainerization originated several centuries ago but was not well developed or widely applied until afte\\n\\n### Containerization (computing)\\n\\nSummary: In software engineering, containerization is operating system-level virtualization or application-level virtualization over multiple network resources so that software applications can run in isolated user spaces called containers in any cloud or non-cloud environment, regardless of type or vendor.\\n\\nRelated\\nAll stub articles- Articles with short description- CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list- CS1 maint: numeric names: authors list- Cloud computing- Computing stubs- Short description matches Wikidata\\n\\n### Containerized housing unit\\n\\nSummary: A containerized housing unit, usually abbreviated as CHU (and sometimes called containerized living unit or CLU) is an ISO shipping container pre-fabricated into a living quarters. Such containers can be transported by container ships, railroad cars, planes, and trucks that are capable of transporting intermodal freight transport cargo.\\nContainer housing units are related to the site and land occupied during a certain amount of time by the need of water supply and excavation, electricity, telecommunications, etc. Plug-in city is a concept that is developing as more units capable of moving by intermodal means are brought up to the market. Local site is thus of most importance on correct container housing units use.  An example of CLU housing is at the Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa base (Camp Lemonnier) in Djibouti.\\nModular shipping containers are typically referred to as isotainers.

Programming and maintaining the source code is the central step of this process, but it also includes conceiving the project, evaluating its feasibility, analyzing the business requirements, software design, testing, to release.  Software engineering, in addition to development, also includes \\nproject management, employee management, and other overhead functions. Software development may be sequential, in which each step is complete before the next begins, but iterative development methods where multiple steps can be executed at once and earlier steps can be revisited have also been devised to improve flexibility, efficiency, and scheduling.\\nSoftware development involves professionals from various fields, not just software programmers but also individuals specialized in testing, documentation writing, graphic design, user support, marketing, and fundraising.

Each sprint is no longer than one month and commonly lasts two weeks. The scrum team assesses progress in time-boxed, stand-up meetings of up to 15 minutes, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: one sprint review to demonstrate the work for stakeholders and solicit feedback, and one internal sprint retrospective. A person in charge of a scrum team is typically called a scrum master.\\nScrum\\'s approach to product development involves bringing decision-making authority to an operational level. Unlike a sequential approach to product development, scrum is an iterative and incremental framework for product development. Scrum allows for continuous feedback and flexibility, requiring team\\n\\n### Agile software development\\n\\nSummary: Agile software development is the mindset for developing software that derives from values agreed upon by The Agile Alliance, a group of 17 software practitioners in 2001. As documented in their Manifesto for Agile Software Development the practitioners value: \\n\\nIndividuals and interactions over processes and tools\\nWorking software over comprehensive documentation\\nCustomer collaboration over contract negotiation\\nResponding to change over following a plan\\nThe practitioners cite inspiration from new practices at the time including extreme programming, scrum, dynamic systems development method, adaptive software development and being sympathetic to the need for an alternative to documentation driven, heavyweight software development processes. \\nMany software development practices emerged from the agile mindset.

An early and successful example is IBM CP/CMS. The control program CP provided each user with a simulated stand-alone System/360 computer. Since then, the meaning of the term has broadened.\\nPopular examples of virtualization software includes VirtualBox and VMware Workstation Player.\\n\\nRelated\\n[- \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - u- n- s- o- u- r- c- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - N- K- C-  - i- d- e- n- t- i- f- i- e- \\n\\n### X86 virtualization\\n\\nSummary: x86 virtualization is the use of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities on an x86/x86-64 CPU.\\nIn the late 1990s x86 virtualization was achieved by complex software techniques, necessary to compensate for the processor\\'s lack of hardware-assisted virtualization capabilities while attaining reasonable performance. In 2005 and 2006, both Intel (VT-x) and AMD (AMD-V) introduced limited hardware virtualization support that allowed simpler virtualization software but offered very few speed benefits. Greater hardware support, which allowed substantial speed improvements, came with later processor models.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\n[- \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - c- o- n- t- a- i- n- i- n- g-  - p- o- t- e- n- t- i- a- l- l- y-  - d- a- t- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- l- l-  - a- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - w- i- t- h-  - u- n- s- o- u- r- c- e- d-  - s- t- a- t- e- m- e- n- t- s- \\'- ,-  - \\'- A- r- t- i- c- l- e- s-  - c- o- n- t- a- i-\\n\\n### Virtual machine\\n\\nSummary: In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is the virtualization or emulation of a computer system.  Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide the functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of the two.\\nVirtual machines differ and are organized by their function, shown here:\\n\\nSystem virtual machines (also called full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide the functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments that are isolated from one another yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, with virtualization-specific hardware features on the host CPUs providing assistance to hypervisors.\\nProcess virtual machines are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-indepen', 'interview_config': None, 'perspectives': {'editors': [{'name': 'John Doe', 'role': 'Lead Editor', 'affiliation': 'University of ABC', 'description': 'Specializes in environmental science.'}, {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'role': 'Editor', 'affiliation': 'Company XYZ', 'description': 'Focuses on technology trends.'}]}, 'conversations': [{'context': 'Increase development productivity by using Docker compose and local docker labs', 'interview_config': None, 'editor': {'name': 'John Doe', 'role': 'Lead Editor', 'affiliation': 'University of ABC', 'description': 'Specializes in environmental science.'}, 'messages': [], 'references': {}}, {'context': 'Increase development productivity by using Docker compose and local docker labs', 'interview_config': None, 'editor': {'name': 'Jane Smith', 'role': 'Editor', 'affiliation': 'Company XYZ', 'description': 'Focuses on technology trends.'}, 'messages': [], 'references': {}}], 'article': '# Increase Development Productivity with Docker Compose and Local Docker Labs\\n\\n## Introduction to Docker Compose\\n\\nDocker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
